CICIDS2017

Raw traffic is obtained from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html. Attack flows are extracted by filtering each workday PCAP files with respect to time interval and IPs described in their webpage. The extracted dataset has 7 types of malware attacks and normal traffic flows.

The total number of flows for different splits:

    test-challenge set: 55,128
    test-std set : 55,128
    traininig set: 441,116

non-vpn2016

PCAP files are downloaded from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/vpn.html. The original dataset has both vpn and non-vpn packet capture files but we only focus on non-vpn captures. In top-level annotation, we categorize the traffic into 7 groups: audio, chat, email, file_transfer, tor, video, P2P. In mid-level annotation, we group into 18 classes according to the application type such as aim_chat, facebook, hangouts, skype, youtube etc. In fine-level annotation, we treat each action as a different category and obtain 31 classes such as facebook_chat, facebook_video, skype_chat, skype_video etc.

The total number of flows for different splits:

    test-challenge set: 16,323
    test-std set : 16,323
    traininig set: 131,065
