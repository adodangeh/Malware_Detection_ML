the MODIFIED NetML Challenge 2020
Update as of July 21, 2021

Dear Competition Participants, Since we announced the results of the Competition in March 2021, we have been in close contact with Intel Corporation, the sponsor of the competition to figure out the logistics of making the awards to the awardees who are from world-wide. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and unforeseen complexity (e.g., the difference in rules and policies specific to geographic regions), the process of distributing the awards to recipients is significantly delayed. Although this is beyond our control unfortunately, we are diligently working with relevant Intel divisions and teams to resolve this as soon as we can.



Thank you.


CICIDS2017

Raw traffic is obtained from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html. Attack flows are extracted by filtering each workday PCAP files with respect to time interval and IPs described in their webpage. The extracted dataset has 7 types of malware attacks and normal traffic flows.

The total number of flows for different splits:

    test-challenge set: 55,128
    test-std set : 55,128
    traininig set: 441,116

non-vpn2016

PCAP files are downloaded from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/vpn.html. The original dataset has both vpn and non-vpn packet capture files but we only focus on non-vpn captures. In top-level annotation, we categorize the traffic into 7 groups: audio, chat, email, file_transfer, tor, video, P2P. In mid-level annotation, we group into 18 classes according to the application type such as aim_chat, facebook, hangouts, skype, youtube etc. In fine-level annotation, we treat each action as a different category and obtain 31 classes such as facebook_chat, facebook_video, skype_chat, skype_video etc.

The total number of flows for different splits:

    test-challenge set: 16,323
    test-std set : 16,323
    traininig set: 131,065
